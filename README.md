# localization-app
An IoT application for geting the local location in a specific floor in real-time 
## Requirements && Description

ESP chip is a microcontroller chip with a wireless module ready for wireless communication. 
Use this chip to develop the below requirements:

1. take wifi strength reading using esp then save it excel sheet **ArduSpreadsheet** to be used in machine learning model training
2. using web socket create a socket connection with sever to send wifi strength
3. the readings should be sent to another server containing the model to get the location 
4. the location then will be viewed in a mobile and web application 
5. the last ten lactations could be used in replay
